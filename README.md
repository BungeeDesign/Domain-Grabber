## Automated Pentesting tool for sub-domain recon.

https://domain.grabber.live


### Overview

#### Domain grabber uses crt.sh & certspotter to grab sub-domains for any given domain. All results can be viewed and then further testing on, domain grabber will look for repeated sub-domains at the first level and then pass subsequent sub-domains to find even more. 

### Automation
